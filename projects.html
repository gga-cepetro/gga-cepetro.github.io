      <h3>Development and practical application of processing techniques,
        regularization, and imaging in the prestack domain based on 3D HPC
        CRS</h3>

      <p>We generalize the Common Reflection Surface (CRS) techniques developed on the
      last project to the prestack domain, and apply it to several important seismic
      imaging problems. Such problems include 5D Regularization, 3D Common Reflection
      Point Migration, Normal Incidence Point Tomography, Image Incident Point and
      Stereotomography. We will also start development on Anisotropic CRS. All these
      techniques will be developed over the new SeisHPC framework, which will provide
      scalability and fault tolerance for very large problems on heterogeneous
      clusters of computers. The project will last for three years, starting at
      February 2016.</p>

      <h3>Processing algorithms and seismic imaging with emphasis in carbonate
        reservoirs</h3>

      <p>Research and development of algorithms for processing and imaging of
      seismic data over carbonate reservoirs. The project aims for the synergetic
      association of (1) the Common Reflection Surface (CRS) method and (2) the
      application of modern signal processing techniques, common in medical
      imaging, radar, sonar and telecommunications. This project has as results
      the following technologies:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>2D/3D Common Reflection Surface (CRS) stacking software: Developed
        using high performance computing (HPC) techniques and able to process 2D
        and 3D seismic data up to Terabytes. A compatible interface with the
        ProMax® package was also developed, along with a manual, allowing its use
        in production level.</li>
        <li>2D/3D Normal Incidence Point (NIP) tomography software: Construction
        of velocity models for depth migration. Designed for parallel computing
        and with a ProMax® interface;</li>
        <li>2D/3D CRS Post-stack Time Migration: Final stages of development;</li>
        <li>Investigations of the latest techniques on time-to-depth conversion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Smart Compression of LWD Acoustic Data</h3>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>The project aims to develop algorithms/software for smart data
      compression of Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) acoustic data. The main focus
      is on developing a pattern recognition algorithm that can automatically
      detect structures on acoustic images away from the borehole. Downhole image
      interpretation based on the pattern recognition algorithm should enable the
      data transfer to the surface acquisition system in real time by mud pulse
      telemetry.</p>
