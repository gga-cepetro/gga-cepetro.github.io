                <p>We generalize the Common Reflection Surface (CRS) techniques developed on the
                last project to the prestack domain, and apply it to several important seismic
                imaging problems. Such problems include 5D Regularization, 3D Common Reflection
                Point Migration, Normal Incidence Point Tomography, Image Incident Point and
                Stereotomography. We will also start development on Anisotropic CRS. All these
                techniques will be developed over the new SeisHPC framework, which will provide
                scalability and fault tolerance for very large problems on heterogeneous
                clusters of computers. The project will last for three years, starting at
                February 2016.</p>

            <p>Research and development of algorithms for processing and imaging of
            seismic data over carbonate reservoirs. The project aims for the synergetic
            association of (1) the Common Reflection Surface (CRS) method and (2) the
            application of modern signal processing techniques, common in medical
            imaging, radar, sonar and telecommunications. This project has as results
            the following technologies:</p>
      
            <ul>
              <li>2D/3D Common Reflection Surface (CRS) stacking software: Developed
              using high performance computing (HPC) techniques and able to process 2D
              and 3D seismic data up to Terabytes. A compatible interface with the
              ProMax® package was also developed, along with a manual, allowing its use
              in production level.</li>
              <li>2D/3D Normal Incidence Point (NIP) tomography software: Construction
              of velocity models for depth migration. Designed for parallel computing
              and with a ProMax® interface;</li>
              <li>2D/3D CRS Post-stack Time Migration: Final stages of development;</li>
              <li>Investigations of the latest techniques on time-to-depth conversion.</li>

            <p>The project aims to develop algorithms/software for smart data
            compression of Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) acoustic data. The main focus
            is on developing a pattern recognition algorithm that can automatically
            detect structures on acoustic images away from the borehole. Downhole image
            interpretation based on the pattern recognition algorithm should enable the
            data transfer to the surface acquisition system in real time by mud pulse
            telemetry.</p>
