    <p>Unicamp is an independent and autonomous university in terms of its
    educational policies, but financially, the university is subordinated to
    the State Government of São Paulo that provides funds for its operation.
    Thus, financial resources are derived mainly from the State Government of
    Sao Paulo and also from national and international institutions that
    promove the development through education and research.</p>

    <p>Unicamp broke with the Brazilian tradition of creating a university by
    simply accumulating courses and units. Instead, it was created based on an
    idea that included all of its present structure. This explains why, even
    before it was established, Unicamp had already attracted more than 200
    foreign academics in a wide range of areas and about 180 academics from the
    best Brazilian universities.</p>

    <p>Unicamp has three campuses - in Campinas, Piracicaba and Limeira - which
    are home to 22 teaching and research centers. It also has a vast hospital
    complex (two large hospitals in Campinas, and one in each of the
    neighboring towns of Sumaré and Hortolândia); 23 interdisciplinary centers;
    two technical high schools; and a series of support units within a universe
    of about 50 thousand people in which thousands of research projects are
    carried out.</p>
