    <p>Founded in
    2013 by Prof. Dr. Martin Tygel, the High Performance Geophysics (HPG) is
    characterized by the production of knowledge in Oil and Gas Geophysics and
    Exploration Geophysics with emphasis on application to industry and / or
    regulatory agencies. The concern of the GGA with practical applications and
    insertion in the productive sector is consistent with the fact that the
    Group is part of the Center for Petroleum Studies (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cepetro.unicamp.br/">CEPETRO</a></a>).  The <a href="http://www.cepetro.unicamp.br/" target="_blank">CEPETRO</a>
    is located at the University of Campinas (<a href="http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/" target="_blank">UNICAMP</a>) and it is responsible
    for conducting a great variety of research and technology development
    projects among <a href="http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/" target="_blank">UNICAMP</a> and many oil and gas companies.</p>

    <p>In summary, the GGA manages to combine research expertise,
    characteristic of its insertion at <a href="http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/" target="_blank">UNICAMP</a>, and technological-business
    excellence, characteristic of insertion in <a href="http://www.cepetro.unicamp.br/" target="_blank">CEPETRO</a>. The GGA’s activities
    are developed in the Applied Geophysics Laboratory (LGA) located on
    <a href="http://www.cepetro.unicamp.br/" target="_blank">CEPETRO</a>’s facilities and fully equipped in terms of human and hardware
    resources.</p>

    <p>GGA's interests are focused on signal processing of data acquired on
    geophysical surveys aiming to construct images in complex geologies and
    inversion of structural and lithological attributes related to exploratory
    targets. It is led by a genuinely multi-disciplinary team, including
    Geophysicists, Applied Mathematicians, Physicists, Geologists and Computing
    Experts. The scope of GGA's work covers both land and marine data of
    Brazilian basins (including exploratory frontiers and pre-salt).</p>

    <p>The described objectives are  achieved with the research and development
    of practical and innovative methods of seismic data processing with
    emphasis on building efficient modeling algorithms, imaging, estimation and
    inversion parameters using the latest high performance computing (HPC)
    techniques. The research results are always analysed by actual members of
    academia and industry, making these results a eligible product with
    immediate application in industry production.</p>
